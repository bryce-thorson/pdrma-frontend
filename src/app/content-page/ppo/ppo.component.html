    <p>PDRMA Health offers agencies the ability to select from several different comprehensive PPO options, including plans
      that pair with a Health Reimbursement Account (HRA). Your Benefits Coordinator can provide you with more information
      about which deductible plan and/or HRA pairing your agency offers.</p>
    <p>You can find answers to many questions about the PPO plan in your PDRMA Health Program Plan Document, or you can ask
      your Benefits Coordinator for a hard copy.</p>

    <p>Our plan has a penalty if your provider fails to pre-certify certain procedures. As a health care consumer, it is your
      responsibility to follow up with your provider to be sure your providerâ€™s office pre-certifies your procedure when
      necessary. See the Care Management section of your plan document for the current list of procedures that require pre-certification.</p>
